KeepInView-jquery-plugin
========================

This plugin is for dynamic web apps when you need a specific selector to be anchored to the top of the page while content above is still being dynamically loaded.

Once the user scrolls, the keepInView will be disabled

Use:

$('selector').keepInView();
